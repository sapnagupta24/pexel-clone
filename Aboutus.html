                        We are student of School of Programming (SOP) is a transformative initiative dedicated to empowering
                        underprivileged
                        students with high-quality software engineering education. Located in Thakurganj, Kishanganj
                        district,
                        Bihar, this campus is exclusively for girls and operates under a unique self-learning system.

                        This program is jointly managed by Project Potential and Navgurukul, two organizations committed
                        to
                        providing free education to economically disadvantaged students, especially those from rural
                        backgrounds.
                        SOP is one of 10 campuses run across different locations, but the Thakurganj campus is the only
                        one in
                        Bihar. Initially established in Kishanganj, it was later relocated to Thakurganj due to
                        unforeseen
                        circumstances.
